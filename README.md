### Description

Peer-to-peer loans issued by the Lending Club (LC) require investors to analyze substantial data before funding. The research literature shows that prediction with this data is challenging. We combine LC data with external economic indicators to establish a foundation for modeling. Using a consistent framework, we model with a range of machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, random forests, and stacking. We supplement these models with NLP techniques applied to the free-text description field that is present in many loan applications. Results show the importance of clarifying the actual investor problem, limitations in the published LC data, and the financial leverage that can be achieved from small statistical gains.
