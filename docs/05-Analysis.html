<h1>Predicting Loan Outcomes using Machine Learning</h1>

<h2>Part 5: Data Analysis</h2>

<p>In this module, we will compare the models developed in the previous module. Based on the strongest model(s), we will look at which predictors have the strongest influence on the results.</p>

<p>We will also explore how different participants in the Lending Club have different measures of ``success''. For example, Lending Club as an institution wishes to improve their grading algorithm and set interest rates commensurate with risk. An individual investor, on the other hand, wishes to minimize the likelihood of default; alternatively, they may wish to maximize their total return, taking into account that a default often follows a history of <i>partial</i> payments and is thus not a total write-off. Choosing an appropriate loss function changes the selection of the most successful model, which is the focus of this module.</p>
