<h2>Part 3: Data Exploration</h2>
<p>In this module, we will revisit the highlights of Milestone 3. We will idenitify which of the available columns are response variables (such as ``recoveries''), which ones are tainted predictors (such as ``interest rate''), and which are candidate predictors (such as ``annual income'').</p>

<p>We will spend some time here discussing ways of using NLP and NLP-like methods to extract useful predictors from the free-text ``description'' field. Examples include the number of words, the richness of the vocabulary, and the rate of spelling errors.</p>

<p>We will also consider in more depth the importance of ``issue date'', which cannot serve directly as a future predictor but whose impact is clearly felt in the data. We will assess several methodolgies for compensating for this effect.</p>
