<h2>Part 2: Data Collection</h2>
<p>This module will discuss some issues with the raw data provided by LC, as well as the need to acquire additional data for context.</p>

<p>The data in the Lending Club dataset covers the period 2008--2015, which includes the global <a href='https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JHDUSRGDPBR'>&ldquo;Great Recession&rdquo; of 2007Q4--2009Q2.</a> In order to account for the variation in economic conditions, we felt it necessary to collect additional data reflecting economic conditions, and join that with the LC data. We used the Federal Reserve ``FRED'' database, and in our presentation we will discuss this process.</p>

<p>We will also discuss the role that selection bias plays in the raw LC data. In particular, the provided dataset only includes loans that were {\it approved} by Lending Club members.</p>
